With EJS, you can create reusable and dynamic content that can be easily rendered on your web applications. This guide is specifically designed for beginners who are interested in learning about EJS and its capabilities for building dynamic web applications.

## Intended Users

This documentation is targeted toward the following users:

- Beginner developers who are new to EJS and want to learn how to use it to build dynamic web applications.

- Experienced developers who are already familiar with EJS but want to refresh their knowledge or learn new techniques.

- Anyone who is interested in web development and wants to learn more about the benefits and capabilities of EJS as a templating language.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

This documentation assumes the following:

- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS: EJS is a templating language that creates HTML markup. Knowing HTML and CSS can be useful when using EJS.

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript: EJS uses JavaScript syntax to generate dynamic content. Understanding JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, and loops can be beneficial.

- Some familiarity with web development concepts: It's helpful to have a basic understanding of web development concepts such as server-side programming, HTTP requests, and rendering HTML pages.

## Software Requirements

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)**: EJS runs on Node.js _(JavaScript runtime environment)_.

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)** : This is required to create and edit your EJS files. You can choose other code editor such as Sublime Text, and Atom.

- **[EJS module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)**
  > This documentation will guide you through the installation process of EJS in a step-by-step manner.

## Procedures Overview

- **[Installing EJS Guide](/EJS-Beginner-Guide/task1)**
  > This section guides you through the process of installing EJS on your local machine. The steps include checking for prerequisites such as having Node.js installed and creating a package.json file using the npm init command. Then, you will be instructed to run the command 'npm install ejs --save' in the project directory using the terminal.

- **[Creating EJS templates](/EJS-Beginner-Guide/task2)**
  > This task explains how to create EJS templates and embed dynamic content within them. The process involves creating a new file with the .ejs extension in the views directory, adding basic HTML markup, using <%= %> tags to embed EJS code in the HTML markup, and passing dynamic data from the server to the EJS template using the res.render() method.
