# Introduction

In this section, we provide a brief overview of EJS and its benefits for building dynamic web applications. We also mention that this guide is intended for beginners who want to learn EJS.

<!-- # What is EJS

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating language used to generate HTML markup. It allows developers to create reusable and dynamic content that can be rendered on web pages. This guide is intended for beginners who want to learn EJS and build dynamic web applications. -->

## Installing EJS 

In this section, we provide step-by-step instructions for installing EJS on your local machine. We mention the prerequisites, such as having Node.js installed and creating a package.json file using the npm init command. Then, we provide the command to install EJS using npm install ejs --save. We also mention that this command should be run in the terminal from the project directory.

## Creating EJS template

In this task, we provide instructions for creating EJS templates and embedding dynamic content in them. We mention creating a new file with the .ejs extension in the views directory of your project and adding basic HTML markup to the file. Then, we provide the syntax for using <%= %> tags to embed EJS code in the HTML markup. Finally, we mention passing dynamic data from the server to the EJS template using the res.render() method.

## Conditional statements in EJS templates

In this task, we provide instructions for using conditional statements in EJS templates to display different content based on conditions. We mention the syntax for creating if statements using <% if (condition) { %> and <% } %> tags. We also provide the syntax for creating else statements using <% if (condition) { %> and <% } else { %> and <% } %> tags. Finally, we mention the syntax for creating else-if statements using <% if (condition1) { %> and <% } else if (condition2) { %> and <% } else { %> and <% } %> tags.

## Glossary

In the glossary section, we provide definitions for the key terms used in the instructions, such as EJS, Node.js, and HTML.

## Troubleshooting Guide

In the troubleshooting guide, we provide solutions to common issues that may arise when following the instructions. For example, if EJS is not installed properly, we recommend reinstalling it using the npm install ejs --save command.
