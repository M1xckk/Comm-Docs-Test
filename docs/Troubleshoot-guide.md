# Troubleshooting Guide

> A Troubleshooting Guide can help users overcome common issues and avoid frustration while learning EJS. Here are some of the most common issues that users might encounter when working with EJS, along with their solutions:

- Issue: The EJS template is not rendering properly.
???+ Solution
      If your EJS template is not rendering correctly, make sure that you have installed EJS and are using it correctly in your code. Check for syntax errors in your template file, and make sure that your data is being passed correctly. You can also try clearing your cache and restarting your server.

- Issue: EJS tags are not being evaluated in the template.
???+ Solution
      If your EJS tags are not being evaluated, make sure that you are using the correct syntax for EJS tags. Use <% %> for control flow and <%= %> for output. Also, check that the EJS tags are not being commented out or enclosed within HTML tags.

- Issue: The EJS template is not displaying data correctly.
???+ Solution
      If your EJS template is not displaying data correctly, there could be a few reasons for this. Check that your data is being passed correctly and that your EJS tags are properly referencing your data. Make sure that your data is not undefined, null, or an empty string.

- Issue: EJS is throwing a syntax error.
???+ Solution
      If EJS is throwing a syntax error, check your EJS tags for syntax errors, such as unclosed or mismatched tags. If you're using a code editor, enable EJS syntax highlighting to catch errors early. Also, make sure that you're using the correct version of EJS that matches your code.

- Issue: EJS is not installed properly.
???+ Solution
      If EJS is not installed properly, you can use the npm install ejs --save command to reinstall EJS. If you're encountering permissions errors, try using sudo npm install ejs --save or running your command prompt as an administrator. You can also check that EJS is listed in your package.json file and that it's included in your project dependencies.

- Issue: EJS is not rendering the correct data types.
???+ Solution
      Make sure that you are passing the correct data type to your EJS template. EJS is capable of rendering strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. If your data type is incorrect, EJS may not render it correctly.

- Issue: EJS is rendering the wrong data.
???+ Solution
      Check that you are passing the correct data to your EJS template. Make sure that you are referencing the correct data when using EJS tags. Also, check that you are not overwriting your data somewhere in your code.

- Issue: EJS is not rendering HTML tags properly.
???+ Solution
      Make sure that you are using the correct syntax for rendering HTML tags in EJS (<%- %> instead of <%= %>). If your HTML tags are not rendering properly, check that your data does not contain any HTML characters that may be causing issues.

- Issue: EJS is not rendering the correct template file.
???+ Solution
      Double-check that you are calling the correct EJS template file in your code. Make sure that the file path is correct and that the file extension is .ejs.

- Issue: EJS is rendering the same data for all pages.
???+ Solution
      Check that you are passing the correct data to each EJS template. If you are using a layout file, make sure that your data is not being overwritten by the layout file. You can also try passing the data explicitly to each template instead of relying on a layout file.

- Issue: EJS is not displaying images or other external resources.
???+ Solution
      Check that the file paths for your external resources are correct. Make sure that the resources are accessible from the location of your EJS template file. You may also need to set the correct MIME type for your external resources if they are not being rendered properly.

- Issue: EJS is rendering slowly or causing performance issues.
???+ Solution
      Check that you are not rendering too much data in your EJS templates. Large data sets can cause EJS to render slowly. You can also try pre-compiling your EJS templates to improve performance. Finally, consider using a caching mechanism to reduce the number of times your EJS templates are rendered.

#### By addressing these common issues, you can ensure that your EJS templates work as expected and that your development process is smooth and efficient.
